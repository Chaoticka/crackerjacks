Ciphey currently supports **50 encryptions, encodings, compression methods, and hashes.**
# Basic Encryptions

* Caesar Cipher
* ROT47 (up to ROT94 with the ROT47 alphabet)
* ASCII shift (up to ROT127 with the full ASCII alphabet)
* Vigen√®re Cipher
* Affine Cipher
* Binary Substitution Cipher (XY-Cipher)
* Baconian Cipher (both variants)
* Soundex
* Transposition Cipher
* Pig Latin


# Modern Day Cryptography
* Repeating-key XOR
* Single XOR

# Encodings
