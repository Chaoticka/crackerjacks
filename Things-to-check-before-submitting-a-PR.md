Hey! So you just finished writing a module for Ciphey? Thank you! <3

Here's a list of things you should check before submitting a PR:
* We use Python Black for our code, please use it if you can (no worries if you can't we'll pick up on it eventually)
* Do you have a dictionary or list of an alphabet, charset, or the likes? Something like the morse code alphabet? It belongs in [CipheyDists](https://github.com/Ciphey/CipheyDists)
* We try to aim for clean code, if you're not familiar with that don't worry we'll help ya out :) 
* Write tests for your code. The #1 most important thing for Ciphey is tests! Add your tests [here](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/blob/master/tests/test_main.py).
* Add this to the top of the file:
```
community
<Your GitHub Profile here>
```
This makes sure everyone knows you wrote that code. The community part is for a new feature we're adding, you won't have to worry about that though :sweat_smile: 
* Once you make a PR, we'll add you to the README and send you a lot of thanks :D
