# Python 3.7 and above
On Linux run this command:

```
python3 -m pip install ciphey --upgrade
```

This will tell your default Python3 version to install Ciphey and upgrade it if it already exists.

**Ciphey only supports Python3.7 and above. Please upgrade Python or use the Docker image if you have a version below 3.7**

# Docker

```
docker run -it --rm remnux/ciphey
```

Our Docker image is maintained by [REMnux](https://remnux.org/).
They have provided a guide on how to use it here.
